Before the stream, what do you need to do?
------------------------------------------
If you are on Mac or Linux; you are good to go.  We'll go through step by step instructions during the first
screencast.

If you are on Windows you should setup a Linux Virtual Machine.  You can get further info here at https://www.virtualbox.org/

I am not Anti-Windows or anything like that.  These streams will very often involve Ruby and the tooling just isn't there for Windows.  If you really want to run Ruby directly on Windows, ok, but you are on your own with that piece of it.

If you are having problems with the Virual Machine setup contact me on the Gitter chat and I'll help you work through it.
