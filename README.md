Before the stream, what do you need to do?
------------------------------------------

Option 1: Follow along in the cloud
-----------------------------------

I will use the Cloud9 editor to edit in the cloud so you can follow long with zero setup required.  To do this create a free account at https://c9.io and then provide me with your Cloud9 username of email address at the beginning of the Streaming session and I will grant you access.

Option 2: Setup the environment so you can code locally
-----------------------------------

I will walk through this during the first streaming session and this is more effort than Option 1, but I really believe in the long run this is the best route for most people to maximize their learning experience.

If you are on Mac or Linux; you are good to go.  We'll go through step by step instructions during the first
screencast.

If you are on Windows you should setup a Linux Virtual Machine.  You can get further info here at https://www.virtualbox.org/

If you are having problems with the Virual Machine setup contact me on the Gitter chat and I'll help you work through it.

Option 3: Both Option 1 & Option 2
----------------------------------

It may be easier to follow along by joining into the shared editor with Cloud 9, but then outside of the stream session you can go back and edit within your local environment and even make pull requests.
